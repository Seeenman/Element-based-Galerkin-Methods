The folders are organized as follows:
Chapters: contains some of the source code used in each chapter.
Projects: contains the source code that the student should be given in order to complete the project.
For Students: These folders contain the sample code that I recommend giving to the student. This way they can concentrate 
on what is most important in the course and to give them time to play with the codes and learn by experimentation.
For Instructors: I have now added the solutions to the projects in order to make it easier for the instructors.

Note: The main driver in each folder is entitled “A_Main_Driver_…” where “…” change with each folder.  
Each folder contains a README file that explains what is contained in that folder.
